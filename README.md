# Colors API

### Simple Node.js & Express API just for learning

### Usage:

Use either the `/colors` (all colors) or the `/colors/` (one single color) endpoint and start experimenting. 

I used the Chrome Extension `RESTED` for testing. You can also find it for Firefox.

I also used VSCodium as IDE this time instead of VSCode. VSCodium is basically the same but with all the propietary software striped out.
Here the [repo](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium) 

You will need to have node and mongodb installed and up and running.

### Run:

`npm install`

`npm start`
